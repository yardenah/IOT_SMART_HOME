# SmartPark ðŸš—ðŸ“±

## Project Overview
SmartPark is an academic project developed as part of a Computer Science degree.  
The project focuses on building an **IoT-based smart parking management system** designed to optimize parking space usage in urban environments.  

## Features
- **Real-time parking detection** using IoT sensors.  
- **User-friendly interface** for drivers to quickly find available parking spots.  
- **Efficient data storage** using a local database (SQLite).  
- **Data processing** and event handling through an MQTT broker.  
- **Notifications & alerts** for payment status and parking availability.  

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (Data management and MQTT client)  
- **SQLite** (Local database for storing parking and payment data)  
- **Paho-MQTT** (MQTT communication)  
- **IoT Simulation** for parking spots and payments  

## Purpose
This project was created **for educational purposes only** as part of a university degree program.  
Its main goal is to demonstrate the integration of **IoT, databases, and real-time communication** in solving real-world urban challenges.
